# Admin Menu Swap

A Drupal module that allows you to provide customised menus for each role.

## INTRODUCTION

Using AMSwap, you can choose which menu is displayed as the main administrative 
menu (under "Manage") for each role. For instance, you can create an "Owner" 
menu, then assign that menu to to the "Owner" role you created.

Inspired by the [Administration Menu](
https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu_source) module.

## REQUIREMENTS

The following Drupal core modules need to be installed and enabled:

but it was inspired by Administration Menu Source.
